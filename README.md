##Tripify

####Project 3 - WDI6, General Assembly

Group project by Karina, Johan, Isha and Marty

This web app lets a user map out a trip to see pins on a world map and graphs about time spent in each location and distance travelled. Unique URL codes are generated so a user can come back and view or edit their trip without needing a login and password.

Built with Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS (Flexbox), D3.js and the MapBox API
